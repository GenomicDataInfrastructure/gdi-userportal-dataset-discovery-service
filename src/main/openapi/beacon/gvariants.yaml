                i.e. to evaluate the acceptance/understanding of a request and the structure of the returned response by 
                the Beacon instance. A TRUE `testMode` parameter DOES NOT require that the Beacon instance is a test 
                instance, but that this specific request-response cycle is a testing one. When `true` the Beacon instance 
                MUST respond the request but it SHOULD use virtual or non-sensitive data. Here, what is being evaluated 
                is the acceptance/understanding of a request and the structure of the returned response by the Beacon 
                instance.
